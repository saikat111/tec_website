                                            Our Undergraduate program is affiliated by University of Rajshahi, second largest university in Bangladesh. The university is ranked third on the Bangladesh University Ranking 2017. The department of  EEE (Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering) is nationally and internationally recognized by its contribution to different fields of Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering. The graduates of this department have gone on to a variety of positions in industry such as Siemens Bangladesh, Ericsson, Grameen Phone, Robi, Banglalink, Airtel, Government services, <strong>PGCB, NESCO, REB</strong>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashuganj_Power_Station_Company_Ltd">Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd</a> (<strong>APSCL</strong>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coal_Power_Generation_Company_Bangladesh_Limited&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Coal Power Generation Company Bangladesh Limited</a> (<strong>CPGCBL</strong>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_Generation_Company_of_Bangladesh">Electricity Generation Company of  Bangladesh</a> (<strong>EGCB</strong>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka_Electric_Supply_Company_Limited">Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited</a> (<strong>DESCO</strong>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka_Power_Distribution_Company_Limited">Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited</a> (<strong>DPDC</strong>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Power_Generation_Company_Limited">North West Power Generation Company Limited</a> (<strong>NWPGCL</strong>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Zone_Power_Distribution_Company_Limited">North West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited</a> (<strong>NWZPDCL</strong>), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Zone_Power_Distribution_Company_Limited">West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited</a> (<strong>WZPDCL</strong>). <strong>BEPZA, BGCL, PDB, NWPCL, BADC, BAPX, BCIC, CPGCL, WASA, GTCL, PGCL, Petro Bangla</strong> and many more privet sectors.

                                            At present we have total 6 experienced teachers and 2 Lab Assistants of the department together with a few part time teachers. Part time teachers are mostly the senior teachers of RUET (Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology) and RU (Rajshahi University).

                                            We are currently enriched with the following labs, Electrical Machine Lab, Electrical Circuit Lab, Electronics Lab, Simulation Lab, Micro-processor Lab and recently we are very pleased to add a completely new Communication Lab.

                                            We have a big library room for study both for teachers and students. For EEE department there are 749 books of 86 distinct items as well as enormous Bangla and English Literature Books.

                                            Recently we have started Guide Teacher Systems for monitoring every student’s performance in class and class test along with lab performance so that we can find out weak students to provide motivation and extra care for them to improve their performance.
