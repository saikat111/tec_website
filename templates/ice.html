                                            Information and Communication Technology is the Engineering Branch that recently came into existence with a mission to provide a wider perspective on the nature of technology, its use and application to the living world. Engineering is not only about the experimentation and learning. It is about the impact it has on the society. Information and Communication Engineering has been the branch of Engineering that humans have used all through the evolution process for being the most advanced creature on the Earth. Moreover developing countries try to improve their lives and gain a competitive edge using Information and Communication.<br><br>

                                            The B.Sc. Engineering courses in Information and Communication Engineering shall be offered over a period of four academic years, each of a normal duration of one calendar year. The four academic years shall be designated as Part-I, Part-II, Part-III and Part-IV in succeeding higher levels of study. The academic year will be divided into two semesters (Odd and Even) each having a duration of 19 weeks. Under no circumstances, any student shall be allowed to continue his/her study for B.Sc. Engineering degree for more than six academic years. A student will be required to have 70% attendance of the total number of periods of lectures/tutorials/laboratory classes held during the semester in every course to appear as a regular candidate at that semester final examinations. The Courses offered for Information and Communication Engineering department will consist of theoretical, practical, viva-voce, quizzes/class tests, attendance, and research project and are of 4000 marks (160 credits). The 3 credits and 2 credits courses carry 75 marks and 50 marks, respectively.</h5></p><br><br><br><br>
